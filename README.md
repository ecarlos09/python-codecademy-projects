Creating Businesses!
19.
Since we’ve been so successful building out a branded chain of restaurants, we’ve decided to diversify. We’re going to create a restaurant that sells arepas!

First let’s define a Business class.

20.
Give Business a constructor. A Business needs a name and a list of franchises.

21.
Let’s create our first Business. The name is "Basta Fazoolin' with my Heart" and the two franchises are flagship_store and new_installment.

22.
Before we create our new business, we’ll need a Franchise and before our Franchise we’ll need a menu. The items for our Take a’ Arepa available from 10am until 8pm are the following:

{
  'arepa pabellon': 7.00, 'pernil arepa': 8.50, 'guayanes arepa': 8.00, 'jamon arepa': 7.50
}
Save this to a variable called arepas_menu.

23.
Next let’s create our first Take a’ Arepa franchise! Our new restaurant is located at "189 Fitzgerald Avenue". Save the Franchise object to a variable called arepas_place.

Now let’s make our new Business! The business is called "Take a' Arepa"!

25.
Congrats! You created a system of classes that help structure your code and perform all business requirements you need. Whenever we need a new feature we’ll have the well-organized code required to make developing and shipping it easy.
